# github-actions-quickstart

This repository is an introduction to GitHub Actions.

Feedback: It may be more helpful for newcomers unfamiliar with GitHub terminology to use the word "folder" instead of "directory." Step 1 is also confusing as you cannot create an empty folder; in order to avoid confusion, you can combine steps 1 and 2 for greater concision, as the folder and file can be created in a single step.
